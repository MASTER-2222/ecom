# RitKART Frontend Deployment Guide

## 🚨 Render Deployment Fix

### Issue Resolved
The deployment error was caused by a dependency conflict between **React 19** and **recharts@2.12.7** which only supported React 16-18.

### ✅ Solutions Applied

1. **Upgraded recharts** to version `^3.1.0` which supports React 19
2. **Added npm configuration** for legacy peer dependencies
3. **Fixed Vite build configuration** issues
4. **Added deployment scripts** for Render

### 📋 For Render Deployment

#### Option 1: Use the custom build script
```bash
npm run build:render
```

#### Option 2: Use the deployment script
```bash
./deploy.sh
```

#### Option 3: Manual deployment command
```bash
npm install --legacy-peer-deps && npm run build
```

### 🔧 Configuration Files Added/Modified

1. **`.npmrc`** - Added legacy peer deps configuration
2. **`package.json`** - Updated recharts version and added overrides
3. **`vite.config.ts`** - Fixed experimental features and build optimization
4. **`deploy.sh`** - Deployment script for Render
